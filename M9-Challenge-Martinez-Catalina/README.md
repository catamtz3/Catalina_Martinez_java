## Module Challenge: Record Store API Secured

### Overview

Starter code: [./starter](./starter)

In this challenge, you will refactor the provided Record Store API to enforce authentication via OAuth.

### Goals

The goal of this challenge is to reinforce your knowledge of OAuth.

Specifically, you'll do the following:

1. Create an Authorization Server which will facilitate authentication via OAuth.

2. Refactor the provided Record Store API application to enforce authentication accordingly.

### Instructions

1. Create a new local folder named `M9-Challenge-Lastname-Firstname`.  Add all code for this challenge to this folder.

2. Using the techniques described in class, create an Authorization Server which will facilitate OAuth authentication for the provided Record Store API application.

3. For the Authorization server, create a few user accounts for testing purposes.

4. Using the techniques described in class, refactor the provided Record Store API starter project such that the controller enforces authentication via OAuth for all Record Store API routes.

5. Using Insomnia, verify the following:

- An unauthenticated client is unable to access any of the API routes.

- An authenticated OAuth client is able to access all routes, including `GET`, `PUT` and `DELETE` operations.

### Submission

1. **Copy your folder:** When you have completed your challenge, copy your completed `M9-Challenge-Lastname-Firstname` folder into your personal GitHub repository, commit, and push to GitHub.

2. **Confirm:** Navigate to your GitHub repository and confirm that the `M9-Challenge-Lastname-Firstname` folder exists and contains your code.
